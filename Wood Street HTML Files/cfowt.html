<h1>Creative Friends<br/>of Wood Street</h1>

<p>'What does Manchester and Salford mean to you?', that's the question we asked the region's very best designers and
    illustrators. Why did we ask this question? Who were we to probe these artisans?</p>

<p>Well, we are 'Wood Street Mission's Creative Friends, a group of creatives
    dedicated to galvanising the creative industries to help raise funds and
    awareness for Manchester based charity
    <a href="http://www.woodstreetmission.org.uk">Wood Street Mission</a>. Whilst
    daydreaming one day one of our number decided to organise a competition to
    create some wonderful Manchester and Salford inspired images. The result is an
    extravaganza of prints from the winning 30 artists each limited to a short
    print-run. Once these are gone, they're gone!</p>

<p>So, more or less, every penny you pay will go directly to Wood Street Mission. Please buy a print, or two. And
    there's no need to feel guilty so why not buy three!</p>
