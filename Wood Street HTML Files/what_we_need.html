<h1>What We Need!</h1>

<p>We are always in need of the following items:
<ul>
    <li>Good quality children's &amp; young adult clothing</li>
    <li>Baby equipment</li>
    <li>Bedding</li>
</ul>

<p>We can also make use of toiletries (shampoo, soap, toothpaste, shower gel,
etc.) and nappies - but only new ones please! Unfortunately we are unable to
redistribute car seats, electrical items or older style clothing and we cannot
accept donations of furniture.</p>

<p>Your donations will be sorted and then given straight out to local families
who are unable to provide such goods for themselves. We do not have the
resources to clean or repair soiled or damaged items, so good quality, clean
items only please.</p>

<p>In October we also start collecting for our Children at Christmas Project,
where we provide substantial parcels of food to families and parcels of brand
new and as-good-as-new toys and gifts for every child.</p>

<p>At this time of year we need donations of non-perishable food: tins of meat,
fish, vegetables and fruit; biscuits; cakes; chocolates &amp; sweets; pasta &amp; rice;
soups, etc. Please ensure that all food is well within its sell-by-date!<p>

<p>We also need donations of new and good quality second-hand toys,
children's/teen books, games, gifts for teenagers, stocking fillers and
children's videos &amp; DVDs.</p>

<p>We have to sort every donation to ensure that each child we help receives a
balanced parcel of Christmas presents, so please do not wrap your Christmas
donations.</p>
